# Electromyography_Program

This program was first design to be used together with an electromyography device. However is objective and application don't require so once, since the data is the format demanded by its design
.
This program allows a simple communication with a serial port in order to read values from it so they can be shown in a real time graph.
You can select you connection from a list of available serial ports, together with the Baud-rate of your connection. You can also record your data and save it to a file.

Have in mind it was made as part of a university project. The objective here was to read data from an electromyography equipment an to be able to follow these data in real time on the screen, also with the possibility of recording it in order to build a library of signals to further study. It was developed in C++ using .NET and can be easily improved.
